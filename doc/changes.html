<H1>Changes to XmlPull v1 API</H1><P>

<h3>IN PROGRESS: <a name="XMLPULL_1_2_1"></a>2003-06-... (XMLPULL_1_2_1)</h3>
<ul>
<li>this will be next official stable release (based on last of 1.1.x) to
incorporate all changes since 1.0.x in stable version </ul>

<h3>IN PROGRESS INTERIM RELEASE: </h3>

<h3><a name="XMLPULL_1_1_3_1"></a>2003-05-19 (XMLPULL_1_1_3_1)</h3>
<ul>
<li>added set of <a href="addons.html">addons</a> that add new functionality
or extend existing interfaces in XmlPull API

<li>updated tests to look for boundary cases with PI/comments and next() (thanks to Henry Minsky)
<li>marked all supported optional features and properties as such in unit tests summary


<li>changed XmlPullParserFactory.newInstance() to use XmlPullParserFactory class
as default class context and not String.class because when using String we will never
find /META-INF/services/org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserFactory resource ...

</ul>

<h3><a name="XMLPULL_1_1_2_1"></a>2003-02-26 (XMLPULL_1_1_2_1)</h3>

<ul>
<li>minor release to make available the latest tests and documentation chnages

<li>added <a href="quick_write.html">quick introduction to using XmlSerializer</a>

<li>added test to check that generating namespae prefix for attributes is allowed
(method getPrefix(uri, true) called after startTag() shoul dadd new prefix to
current start tag elements and not next start tag)

<li>added tests to check optional support for formatting XML output from XML serializer

<li>SAX2 driver moved to addons,
removed AttributesCachingDriver but left documented how to achieve this functionality
<li>added to addons XML RPC implementation
</ul>


<h3><a name="XMLPULL_1_1_2"></a>2002-10-16 (XMLPULL_1_1_2)</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>NOTE:</b> <b>potentially backward incompatible change to nextToken</b>():
XMLDecl (&lt;?xml ... ?&gt;) will no longer be reported as PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION
but instead content of XMLDecl is made available as set of properties
<a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/properties.html#xmldecl-version">XMLDECL VERSION</a>
<a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#xmldecl-standalone">XMLDECL STANDALONE</a>
and
<a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#xmldecl-content">XMLDECL CONTENT</a>.

<li>J2ME compatibility issue fixed: changed to use <tt>instanceof</tt> instead
of .class in XmlPullParserFactory

<li>added to XmlSerializer three new utility methods:
getDepth(), getName(), and getNamespace()
to allows intelligent closing of serialized output for example
when writing error/fault information into serialized XML stream
from inside exception handler

<li>changed tests to reflect changed handling of XMLDecl
and added tests to check for optional XMLDecl properties

<li>XmlSerializer is now required to throw exception when user tries to
write startTag() in default namespace ("") and default namespace is bound
to non-empty string, added test to check for it

<li>added patch by Holger Krug to SAX2 Driver to allow modification in sub classes
of how Attributes in startElement() are kept. Added also AttributesCachingDriver
that extends SAX2 Driver to create a new copy of Attributes for each startElement()
so Attributes provided in startTag() will not change during parsing and can be kept
indefinitely (not that Attributes object is created for each startTag() and this
is expensive both perfromance and memory wise and is not required by SAX2.

<li>more tests to check for CDATA end-of-line normalization

<li>changed tests to require support for ROUNDTRIP==false
and additional checks for EOL normalization of tokens

</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><a name="XMLPULL_1_1_1"></a>2002-08-27 (XMLPULL_1_1_1)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEW! XmlSerializer API</strong> that is now required part of XMLPULL
API on J2SE (on J2ME typically factory is not used and only implementation of
serializer or parser may be available).

<li><b>NOTE:</b> <b>potentially backward incompatible change to nextToken</b>():
content returned by getText()/getTextCharacters() is end-of-line normalized and
also IGNORABLE_WHITESPACE for content outside element root and end-of-line
unnormalized content for elements MAY not reported by nextToken() (unless optional
<a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#xml-roundtrip">XML ROUNDTRIP
feature</a> is false). However if&nbsp;
<a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#xml-roundtrip">XML ROUNDTRIP
feature</a> is true parser behavior is exactly the same as in previous XmlPull
API version . This change is made to improve compatibility with XML
by requiring normalized content as described in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-line-ends">XML 1.0 End-of-Line
Handling</a> and with XML infoset <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#infoitem.document">Document
Information Item properties</a> which only contain comments and processing
instructions but not white space content (so now reporting IGNORABLE_WHITESPACE
event outside is optional).&nbsp;

<li>added optional features&nbsp; EXPAND ENTITY REF and SERIALIZER ATTVALUE USE
APOSTROPHE<li>added optional properties related to indenting serializer output
(pretty printing): SERIALIZER INDENTATION,&nbsp; SERIALIZER LINE SEPARATOR<li>added clarification to nextToken() that there is no requirement for reported
token events to be coalesced (for example nextToken() may report multiple
consecutive TEXT or IGNORABLE_WHITESPACE events). This is different from next()
that always report exactly one TEXT event<li>conformance tests can be now described in XML allowing to keep tests in
format independent from Java (and potentially to use the same XML tests with
other XmlPull API bindings such as C++ or PHP) XML files with tests are read
from CLASSPATH<li>added newSerializer() method to XmlPullParserFactory

<li>added new FAQ entries:

<ul>

<li><a href="faq.html#API_DESIGN">Why is there only one "large" interface,
wouldn't it be cleaner to use event objects and polymorphism?</a>


<li><a href="faq.html#3NEXT">What is the difference between
<tt>nextToken()</tt>, <tt>next()</tt>, <tt>nextTag()</tt>, and <tt>nextText()</tt>?</a>

<li><a href="faq.html#NEXT_MOTIV">Why are there different <tt>next()</tt> methods, wouldn't it be cleaner to
have a set method, allowing me to specify the type of events I am interested in
in general?</a>

</ul>



<li>list of class names with factory, serializer and/or parser must be now
separated by colon in XMLPULL tests property (<code>org.xmlpull.v1.tests</code>), for example:
<code>-Dorg.xmlpull.v1.tests=DEFAULT:org.xmlpull.mxp1.MXParser,org.xmlpull.mxp1_serializer.MXSerializer</code>

<li>changed XmlPullParser constants to  be all consistently <samp>int</samp> (few were declared as
<samp>byte</samp> ...)

</ul>

<h3><a name="XMLPULL_1_0_8"></a>2002-04-24 (XMLPULL_1_0_8)</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>two API changes are not backward compatible</b> with 1.0.7:
<ul>
<li><b>readText</b>() function was <b>removed</b>, please use nextText() instead
<li><b>require</b>() is <b>changed</b> - no longer will skip white space content
</ul>
<li>added <b>new functions</b>:<ul>
<li>getAttributeType(index)
<li>isAttributeDefault(index)
<li>setInput(InputStream is,  String inputEncoding)
<li>getInputEncoding()
<li>nextText()
<li>nextTag()
</ul>
<li>modified tests to allow -1 for column or line number and updated Javadoc to reflect it
<li>
updated all tests to check new functions<li>
modified test driver PackageTest to accept list of XMLPULL factories or parsers
to check from system property <b>org.xmlpull.v1.test</b>, DEFAULT can be used to
indicate using of default parser factory (taken from system property or resource
from CLASSPATH), for example: <br>
-Dorg.xmlpull.v1.tests=DEFAULT,org.xmlpull.mxp1.MXParser<li>
modified XmlPullParserFactory to use resource from CLASSPATH when not only classNames is null
but also if classNames is empty String or if it is equal to &quot;DEFAULT&quot;<li>
improved error messages in XmlPullParserFactory to better diagnose why new pull
parser can not be created<li>
added test to check that when on END_TAG namespaces that were declared in
corresponding START_TAG are still accessible even though they are not in scope<li>
added tests to check that setInput() does not read any bytes from input stream
or characters from reader until first call to next()</ul>

<h3>2002-04-20 (XMLPULL_1_0_7_1)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
fixed Quick Introduction to use correct API for getTextCharacters and
getEventType (instead of getType)<li>
added requirement to getNamespace(prefix) to have 'xml' and 'xmlns' pre-declared<li>
removed from getNamespace(prefiix) exception XmlPullParserException as this
function simply returns null when namespace is not declared ...<li>
updated tests:<ul>
<li>updated header with license pointer to <a href="http://www.xmlpull.org">
http://www.xmlpull.org</a>
<li>added printing test summary (parser used, supported features)
<li>added one test to check that tokens are equivalent to events (next() &lt;-&gt;
nextToken())
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400"><a name="XMLPULL_1_0_7"></a></span>2002-04-08 (XMLPULL_1_0_7)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
changed default namespace semantics: the prefix must be reported as null and not
empty string from getNamespacePrefix(depth) and getNamespace(null) must return
default namespace if declared in XML<li>
modified getText() method behavior for ENTITY_REF: in this case getText() must
return entity replacement text and getTextCharacters() returns actual input
buffer with entity name the same as getName()<li>
for ENTITY_REF token getName() must return entity name<li>
added specific requirement that attribute values MUST be normalized</ul>

<h3>2002-04-06 (XMLPULL_1_0_6)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
changed hard coded parser factory in XmlPullParserFactory name for KXML2 to
org.kxml2.io.KXmlParserFactory<li>
clarified required semantics in <a href="features.html">features</a> description
<li>
refactored XmlPullParserFactory: <ul>
<li>reduced in size as much as possible,&nbsp;
<li>String classNames
in newInstance() can now specify both
factories and parsers
<li>removed method newInstance(String classNames) the same can be done with newInstance(classNames,
null)<li>modified  tests  use newInstance(*,null) instead of one argument version</ul>
<li>
removed constructor with line numbers and Throwable from XmlPullParserException<li>
changed API to add default namespace declaration to be counted in
getNamespaceCount() and available from getNamespace...(...) methods<li>
refactored tests for common problem: check if no XMLPULL implementation
available and print just one error message (instead of dozen...)</ul>

<h3>2002-04-03 (XMLPULL_1_0_5)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
changed features URI to point to actual documentation on
<a href="http://www.xmlpull.org">http://www.xmlpull.org</a>&nbsp;
<li>
automatic JUnit tests now covers whole API<li>
clarified isWhitespace() can only be checked on TEXT, IGNORABLE_WHITESPACES,
CDSECT<li>
clarified what is attribute namespace for xmlns:ns='...' when
FEATURE_REPORT_NAMESPACE_ATTRIBUTES is set<li>
changed defineCharacterEntity() to defineEntityReplacementText() and described
semantics of this function and its motivation in J2ME environments<li>
clarified how nextToken() works: return un-normalized (no end-of-line
normalization) parts of XML input<li>
if additional feature i set then XML text of START_TAG and END_TAG token is
available allowing to do full XML document roundtrip: reproduce on output
exactly what was in input. However this works on level of UNICODE characters
(UTF16 char in Java) and output will need to be converted into required encoding
(like UTF8 or UTF16).<li>
getNamespacesCount changed to getNamespaceCount for consistency<li>
getAttributesCount changed to getAttributeCount for consistency</ul>

<h3>2002-03-30 (XMLPULL_1_0_4)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
added FEATURE_ prefix to all feature constants<li>
changed function name getType() to getEventType()<li>
clarified that getNamespacesCount() does not include default namespaces
declarations (xmlns='...')<li>
specified that attributes if has no namespace declared will have &quot;&quot; namespace
(empty string)<li>
clarified that when getTextCharacters&nbsp; returns null then holder MUST
contain start and length will be set to -1]
<li>added more comprehensive JUnit tests for API conformance
</ul>

<h3>2002-03-29 (XMLPULL_1_0_3)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
changed getTextCharacters to use pass by reference two int parameters (char[]
getTextCharacters (int [] holderForStartAndLength)<li>
nextToken() is required to return actual input data with getText()&nbsp; (no
end-of-line normalization) - this will allow to reconstruct input XML</ul>

<h3>2002-03-28 (XMLPULL_1_0_2a)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
fixed typos in getAttribute(s)* and getNamespace(s)* functions<li>
numerous improvements to interface documentation<li>
clarified PROCESS_DOCDECL and removed REPORT_DOCDECL
<li>
initial release of JUnit tests (very limited for now ...)</ul>

<h3>2002-03-25 (XMLPULL_1_0_1)</h3>
<ul>
<li>first interim release of API and supporting files (incomplete)
</ul>
